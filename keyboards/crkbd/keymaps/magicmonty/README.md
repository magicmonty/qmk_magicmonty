# The Seelen Corne

This is a Corne keyboard layout inspired by Miryoku but tweaked for the [Soul layout](https://kennetchaz.github.io/symmetric-typing/soul.html) 
but to be used with a standard german keyboard layout (on OS level).

These are the layers:

![Base Layer](assets/base_layer.png)

![Extra Layer](assets/extra_layer.png)

![Home row mods](assets/homerow_mods.png)

![Navigation Layer](assets/navigation_layer.png)

![Number Layer](assets/number_layer.png)

![Symbol Layer](assets/symbol_layer.png)

![Media Layer](assets/media_layer.png)

![Function Layer](assets/function_layer.png)

The layer images are created with [Keyfab](https://jaroslaw-weber.github.io/keyfab)
